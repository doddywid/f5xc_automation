   # vesctl configuration create app_firewall -i waf-policy.yaml 
   To update WAF policy, update waf-policy.yaml accordingly, then execute the following
   # vesctl configuration replace app_firewall -i waf-policy.yaml 
   To delete WAF policy, execute the following
   # vesctl configuration delete app_firewall <waf policy name>

8. Origin Pool
   To create origin pool, execute the following
   # vesctl configuration create origin_pool -i origin-pool1.yaml
   To update origin pool, update origin-pool1.yaml accordingly, then execute the following
   # vesctl configuration replace origin_pool -i origin-pool1.yaml

   To update HTTP loadbalancer, update waf-policy.yaml accordingly, then execute the following
   # vesctl configuration replace http_loadbalancer -i lb.yaml 
   To delete HTTP loadbalancer, execute the following
   # vesctl configuration delete http_loadbalancer <HTTP loadbalancer name>

Note: HTTP loadbalancer object depends on both origin pool and WAF policy object accordingly. Thus, origin pool and WAF policy object need to be created prior creating HTTP loadbalancer object.
